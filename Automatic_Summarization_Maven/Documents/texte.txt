the height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.
i noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too.
i don't have problems with the depth adjustment, the speed control, the collet ( i haven't tried the 1/4" sleeve yet) .
it is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely.
the depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the m12v than it was on my old router.
it's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool, and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great.
the height adjustment works well- not perfect.
the adjustment knob seemed ok, but when lowering the router, i have to practically pull it down while turning the knob.
i built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits.
the depth adjustment was sloppy.
the only not-so-positive comment i have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately.
the major reasons i didn't give it a five are:  one, i didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.
i replaced it with a router raizer and it works much better.
