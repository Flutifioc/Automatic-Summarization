the package also comes with a usb cable, an ac adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your zen touch in.
the earbuds are great headphones as good as my agk studio 240, well not as good but darn close.
the earbud headphones are really nice.
the headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when i bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that i know doesn't come with every one.
the supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre ipod buds.
feature for feature, i find it a very sweet little player; equipped with a higher end headphone system, between this and th larger zen ihardly use my home stereo system anymore.
have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility.
and supply those stupid white headphones.
the headphones are not very comfortable, but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have.
you get a usb cable headphones, a pouch, software except headphones you will like every thing else.
what i dont like: nothing much except headphones, belt clip design.
the headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".
the included headphones suck, so get your own.
